                    <p>&#160&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Ross Wakefield. I am a graduate from Auburn University with a degree in Psychology.  I am a self taught UI&#47UX developer and have developed a passion for web and mobile development.  My passion is to help people and that passion has an impact on everything I do.  I am an avid volunteer in my community and am constantly involved with different non&#45profit organizations and churches.  I have a passion for music and have played many different instruments in many different places, from playing bass guitar in small rock venues to playing banjo in a Roma village in western Ukraine.   I enjoy interactions with people and enjoyed studying psychology to further my understanding of the mind.  Today I use my knowledge of psychology and my passions for people and music to develop creative and innovative solutions for web and mobile users.  I enjoy the chance to create using front&#45end developer languages to provide ways of improving people&#39s experiences and solving their web&#45based problems.          </p>

                    <h3>My Story</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have worked for a small development company for the past two years.  One year full time and the following year as a part-time contractor.  After graduating college I become intrigued with front-end web developing.  Languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript provided a space for creativity and a chance for problem solving.  I have been sharpening my skills and learning new techniques everyday since I started.  The ever changing landscape of languages and libraries provides an exciting scene for creativity as new toolsets enable sleeker and faster methods for web development.  I may still be young in the developer world but everyday I try and learn something new by reading multiple articles and taking classes through organizations such as codeschool.com.  I have experience in working through github, working in the open source portal system of liferay, and applying inovative libraries to my JavaScript such as Angular.js and jQuery.  As a developer I take great pride in my work staying extra hours and working through nights to fix bugs or get the code just right.  I love collaboration and enjoy talking through problems with others and gleaning what I can from their knowledge.  I look forward to continuing development as a developer and driving forward to expand my experience to further my knowledge.</p>
