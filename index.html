                    <h3>My Story</h3>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have worked for a small development company for the past two years.  One year full time and the following year as a part-time contractor.  After graduating college I become intrigued with front-end web developing.  Languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript provided a space for creativity and a chance for problem solving.  I have been sharping my skills and learning new techniques everyday since I started.  The every changing landscape of languages and librarys provides an exciting scene for creativity as new toolsets show sleeker and faster methods.  I may still be young in the developer world but everyday I try and learn something new by reading multiple articles and taking classes through organizations such as codeschool.com.  I have experience in working through github, working in the open source portal system of liferay, and applying inovative libraries to my JavaSciprt such as Angular.js and jQuery.  As a developer I take great pride in my work staying extra hours and working through nights to fix bugs or get the code just right.  I love collaboration and enjoy talking through problems with others and gleaning what I can from their knowledge.  I look forward to continuing development as a developer and toeard new experience to further my knowledge.</p>
