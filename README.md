Personal website and code examples
This repository holds code to my personal website and any attahced pages that I use as code examples.

My main personal site uses the bootstrap grid system and was built to be simple and clean.  
I kept any special features of the site simple but still engaging the user.
Some of these features are parallax scrolling and a fixed header.
The site shows examples of css and html use with bootsrap grid system.
The Weather Application is a page linked off of the main site.
I developed it as an example of Javascript and jQuery.
